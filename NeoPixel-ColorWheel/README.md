# NeoPixel ColorWheel

Somewhat recently, I came by one of these [AdaFruit NeoPixel rings](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463) to try out with my daughter using my old Arduino Uno. Turns out colored LEDs are fun and appealing for kids and even for grown up kids!

After working through some of the [examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel/tree/master/examples) in the NeoPixel library, we decided to try and recreate the iconic color wheel.
